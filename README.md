A number of separate analyses are run as part of the project:

1) English ratings
2) Hungarian ratings
3) Cross-linguistic data (excluding all Indo-European languages + Hungarian)
4) Indo-European languages based on Google Translations
5) Indo-European roots

Raw data files are in raw_data, arranged by analysis.
Final data files are in final_data.
Data processing scripts are in data_processing.
Saved models are in the model folder.
The analysis is all in rough_r_master_analysis.Rmd.
